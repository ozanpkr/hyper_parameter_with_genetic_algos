# Role of Genetic Algorithm in Hyperparameter Optimization

## Overview

This project explores the use of Genetic Algorithms (GA) to optimize the hyperparameters of the AlexNet architecture. The goal is to improve the performance of the model by fine-tuning key hyperparameters such as dropout rate and the number of neurons in fully connected layers.

## Problem Statement

The optimization of hyperparameters is a critical step in improving the performance of machine learning models, particularly deep learning architectures like AlexNet. Standard hyperparameters often result in suboptimal performance, and manually tuning them can be time-consuming and inefficient. In this study, Genetic Algorithms are employed to automate the process of hyperparameter optimization.

## Methodology

### Initial Setup:
- The default hyperparameter values were used initially, resulting in a validation loss of 0.9903798446059227.
  
### Genetic Algorithm Optimization:
- Genetic algorithms were used to optimize the hyperparameters.
- The best combination of hyperparameters was found to be:
  - **Dropout**: 0.7
  - **First fully connected layer neurons**: 1024
  - **Second fully connected layer neurons**: 1024
  
### Results:
- The optimization process resulted in a reduced validation loss of 0.8612949788570404.
- The new configuration produced a 0.13 lower error than the best value observed during training with standard parameters, demonstrating the effectiveness of Genetic Algorithm-based optimization.

## Benefits of Using Genetic Algorithm:
- **Automated Hyperparameter Search**: The use of GA allows for an automated and efficient search for the optimal hyperparameter values.
- **Improved Model Performance**: By optimizing hyperparameters, the model's validation loss is reduced, leading to better generalization.
- **Efficient Optimization**: Genetic Algorithms can explore a wide range of hyperparameter configurations in fewer iterations than manual tuning.
